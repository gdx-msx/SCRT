   Sound Cartridge RAM Tester v0.5 by GDX

--------------------------------------------

 SCRT allows you to check the functioning of your Sound Cartridge RAM.
 Konami's Sound Cartridge has 64kB expandable to 128kB. SCRT supports also the
 Popolon's Sound Cartridge that can have 512kB, 1024kB or 2048kB.

= Use =

 SCRT.COM is a command that you have to enter under MSX-DOS.

 Once executed, the slot number in which the Sound Cartrige is inserted is
 displayed, then an array containing "X" for bad segments and/or "O" for
 segments without error found is also displayed. The first row (row 0) is for
 segments 0 through 15 (128kB), and so on.

 You can add the /Sn or /Sn-n option after the command to select yourself the
 slot to check. The option must be separated by a space.
 First n is the primary slot number and the second n after the hyphen is the
 secondary slot number. Slot number is a value from 0 to 3.
